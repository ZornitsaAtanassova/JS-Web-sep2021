## About the Module
_JavaScript is unique in that it allows the same programming language and tools for the back-end and front-end of an application. In the "JS Web" module, you'll learn about developing server-side applications with Node.js and Express.js, as well as some of today's most popular technologies for building user interfaces. The module will also address the architecture and structuring of Single Page Applications and retrieving data from a REST service via queries. During the training we will understand how to create a server with Node.js, we will learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB using modern concepts and tools. Views and templates for data visualization (templates), models, components, data binding, working with multiple views, routing, extracting data from a REST service, and many others are studied. The module emphasizes many hands-on exercises that involve you in real-world web development projects, implementing site fragments, and creating complete modern websites with a good look, modern structure, and mobile support._
